Yanggok HighSchool Festival AI Club's Exhibition works. (My works)



# Making Process
I use the TeachableMachine to create the model, employing 300 images for each class. After obtainig the model, I use tkinter Library to make UI that has pose instruction text on the top, the webcam feed on the middle, the score and the remaining time on the bottom.

# Limitation
Model was trained by the data of only two people and same background. So, it has the problem. When background changes, Model's perfomance extremely decreased. I would guess that since the dataset consists entirely of East Asian individuals, there might be a more significant performance decline when used by individuals of Western descent.
